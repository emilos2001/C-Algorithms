These are the basics algorithms in C - language;
Alphabet:
That simple algorithm select all vowels contains in the first  array.
In this example with helps by two for loops, iterate through the first array,
which contain the english alphabet, 
and compare with the letters in the second string array which contains the vowels(aieou),
and print all vowels from the first array.
Factorial:
The factorial of a number, is followed by the formula: n! = n Ã— (n - 1)!.
This algorithm let user introde any positive number and then he calculate the factorial number.
If user introduce the negative number, program warns the user for negative number and let introduce the
new number again.
